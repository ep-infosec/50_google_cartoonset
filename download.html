        We provide two disjoint sets of 10k and 100k random cartoons, which can be downloaded here:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://storage.cloud.google.com/cartoonset_public_files/cartoonset10k.tgz"
                 download="cartoonset10k.tgz"
                 onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Files', 'click', 'cartoonset10k')">cartoonset10k.tgz</a> (450MB)</li>
          <li><a href="https://storage.cloud.google.com/cartoonset_public_files/cartoonset100k.tgz"
                 download="cartoonset100k.tgz"
                 onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Files', 'click', 'cartoonset100k')">cartoonset100k.tgz</a> (4.45GB)</li>
        </ul>

      The cartoon images are named <b>csX.png</b>, where <b>X</b> is a hash computed from the cartoon's
      attribute configuration.
      <p>
      Each cartoon image has an accompanying <b>csX.csv</b> file that lists the attributes for that cartoon.
      Each line in the attribute file contains the attribute name, the index of the selected variant, and the
      total number of variants for that attribute, for example:
      <pre>
      "face_shape", 4, 7
      "facial_hair", 14, 15
      "hair", 29, 111
      "eye_color", 2, 5
      ...
      </pre>

    <h3>Dataset Design</h3>
    <div class="pc">
      <p>
        Each cartoon face in these sets is composed of <b>16 components</b> that vary in <b>10 artwork
        attributes</b>, <b>4 color attributes</b>, and <b>4 proportion attributes</b>.
        Colors are chosen from a discrete set of RGB values. The number
        of options per attribute category ranges from 3, for short/medium/long chin length, to 111,
        for the largest category, hairstyle. See below for a description of each attribute.
        <br><br>
        Each of these components and their variation were drawn by the same artist, Shiraz Fuman,
      resulting in approximately <b>250</b> cartoon component artworks and <b>~10<sup>13</sup></b> possible
        combinations. The artwork components are divided into a fixed set of layers
        that define a Z-ordering for rendering. For instance, the face shape is defined on a layer below
        the eyes and glasses, so that the artworks are rendered in the correct order. Hair style is a
        more complex case and needs to be defined on two layers, one behind the face and one in front.
        There are 8 total layers: hair back, face, hair front, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, facial hair,
        and glasses.
        <br><br>
        The mapping from attribute to artwork is also defined by the artist such that any random
        selection of attributes produces a visually appealing cartoon without any misaligned
        artwork; this sometimes involves handling interaction between attributes. For example, the
        proper way to display a “short beard” changes for different face shapes, which required the
        artist to create a “short beard” artwork for each face shape.
